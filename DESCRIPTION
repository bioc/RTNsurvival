Description: RTNsurvival is a tool for integrating regulons generated
        by the RTN package with survival information for the same set
        of samples (i.e. a cohort). It visualizes the integrated data
        using 2-tailed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA2) approach
        and survival plots [@Castro2016]. This package is implemented
        using S4 classes and methods for plots and analyses. There are
        two main survival analyses generated by RTNsurvival: a Cox
        Proportional Hazards approach used to model regulons as
        predictors of survival time, and a Kaplan-Meier analysis
        showing the stratification of a cohort based on the regulon
        activity. For a given regulon, the 2-tailed GSEA approach
        computes a differential Enrichment Score (dES) for each
        individual sample, and the dES distribution of all samples is
        then used to assess the survival statistics for the cohort. The
        plots can be fine-tuned to the user's specifications.
